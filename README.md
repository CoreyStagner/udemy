Training Exercises for my Udemy Courses

# Notes
Each lesson that I am using has it's own folder inside the udemy-lessons directory. 

If I make any personal comments I will write my name then comment ex. // Corey - This is a comment I made.

If the comment was created by the teacher it will just be a comment ex. // This is a teacher made comment.

# Backbone.js


# Angular.js

used Bower to install

-Packages Installed-
angular
angular-resource (allow angular to use to connect to REST API on the server side.)
angular-route (This is an angular Router)

# React.js

used Bower to install 

-Packages Installed-
react
backbone
react-router

Not a complete solution. As how most are a full MVC or MV* and maybe some routers, but React is only a View component.

Since React does not have a model to interface with our REST API on the back end, we are free to use however we want.
In this example I am going to use the Model component from backbone.
