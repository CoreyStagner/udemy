Training Exercises for my Udemy Courses

# Notes
Each lesson that I am using has it's own folder inside the udemy-lessons directory. 

If I make any personal comments I will write my name then comment ex. // Corey - This is a comment I made.

If the comment was created by the teacher it will just be a comment ex. // This is a teacher made comment.
